Bringing positivity to your fingertips

## The context

As part of a 9 weeks Bootcamp at Le Wagon Madrid we have to work on a real case project for the two last weeks. 

ðŸ¤– The ambitious project is to create a motivational bot which would provide a personalised pep talk. This pep talk would be inspired from reknowned speakers like Simon Sinek, Tonny Robbins, Oprah etc. ðŸŽ‰

ðŸŒŸA bot ready to uplift and inspire people whenever they need it most.

## The Data

ðŸ§® The main database we used to train our model is from Hugging Face: jkhedri/psychology-dataset

We then used youtube-transcript-api to :
- download motivational speech from expert in the fields (the likes of Simon sinek, Oprah, Tony Robbins, Eckhart Tolle )
- leverage on experts on particular topics (ie eating disorder, anger management etc) to custommise the pep talk in a more professional/specific way. 

## The Models

-  Clustering:

At first glance we wanted to leverage on pretrained ayoubkirouane/BERT-Emotions-Classifier but this model was only able to classify in 10 topics (and half of them were positive sentiments which were not useful to our case)

ðŸ›  We've tried to do a semantic clusterring to define the optimal numnber of clusters for our database questions. We've used the AgglomerativeClustering model and the silhouette score from sklearn. That way as per the elbow method we figured that about 40 topics was the optimal number of labels. 

- Labelling:

We've tried to use Machine Learning model like LDA to cluster our database question into 40 topics but the results were sub-par. 
As a result we've decided to manually label 10% of our dataset to train a RNN model.

ðŸ§  We then used that RNN model to attach a label to each additional statement.

- Generative AI:

ðŸ’¬ We used transformers from Hugging Face (ie "t5-small") to generate a basic answer to a user feeling. This was giving decent summary but we were not able to get it specific to our user.

- Langchain :

Langchain structure was the answer to customise the answer to the user. 
ðŸ’¬Langchain used relevant summaries from expert advice and copied the style of motivational speakers. 

## The Front end 

We are using streamlit to showcase our project on Demo day.
We are very happy of our final prototype version which showcase an AI generated audio and video (leveraging on the D-iD API, studio.d-id.com)

## Supportive Presentation

On demo day we've used a presentation on the side of our streamlit app to explain our reasoning and the processus we've been through: https://www.canva.com/design/DAF_ZCeuL48/guncB5aWjDr5gVjIY1twqw/edit?utm_content=DAF_ZCeuL48&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton
